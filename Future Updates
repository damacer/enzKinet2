Updates to be made to enzKinet package

- Add substrate name input. This will allow the KmA, KmB, etc to be returned as KmNAME, thus more clear.
- Add user input file. This would make it more like a real website version
X Add graphs vs secondary substrates/inhibitors/activators
X Allow multiple models to be run consecutively (i.e. ping-pong and TC).
X Update functions to display parameters on graphs.
  - Move annotations based on data.
- Discuss code with an R expert to determine how to optimise package.
X Standardise all graphs (labels).
X Add statistics.
- Allow users to define the regression type to be used (lm, nls, etc.).
- Check that data has the correct number of columns for the chosen method.
- Add plotting options to change how data is graphed (i.e. subplots)
- Add more user options (tickmarks, legend name, tables)
- Allow exporting of fitted model csv
X Allow custom equations
  - Improve stability and error messages of custom equation functions

R Tutorial Questions
- = vs <-.
- Simplify model functions into one generalised one.
- What is a factor and how does it affect the error "Discrete value applied to continuous scale".
- How to prevent nls from having a singlular gradient, particularly when a variable is missing from the formula.


Best way to integrate package into a website.
- Just use R markdown
- Don't do a webpage
- Shiny is horrible to work with
- Cost of hosting or requires a constantly running computer
- Requires lots of work- either me learning new languages or hiring someone else.
- Will break constantly
- Can just provide the package
- Better for students to use R so they can learn the basics than giving them an easy access website.
