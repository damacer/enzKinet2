Updates to be made to enzKinet package

- Add substrate name input. This will allow the KmA, KmB, etc to be returned as KmNAME, thus more clear.
X Add user input file. This would make it more like a real website version
X Add graphs vs secondary substrates/inhibitors/activators
X Allow multiple models to be run consecutively (i.e. ping-pong and TC).
X Update functions to display parameters on graphs.
  - Move annotations based on data.
- Discuss code with an R expert to determine how to optimise package.
X Standardise all graphs (labels).
X Add statistics.
- Allow users to define the regression type to be used (lm, nls, etc.).
X Check that data has the correct number of columns for the chosen method.
  X Change columns based on title if there are more than the ideal number of columns
- Add plotting options to change how data is graphed (i.e. subplots)
- Add more user options (tickmarks, legend name, tables)
X Allow exporting of fitted model csv
X Allow custom equations
  - Improve stability and error messages of custom equation functions
