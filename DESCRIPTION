Description: This package contains models of enzyme kinetics. Users input data
    into their model of choice, and the analysis will be performed for them. The
    models will return graphs of experimental data overlaid with the model
    output, as well as a plot of residuals. Parameter estimates are also
    returned base on the model used (Km, Vmax, etc.).
    This particular update is for website application, thus removes the graphs,
    plots, and print statements that were present in the original enzKinet
    package.
